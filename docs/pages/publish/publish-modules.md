# Publish Modules

One of the key features of a secure and accessible module marketplace is providing a platform and tools for developers to build 
and publish the modules in a secure and convenient way. At ZenGuard we make sure to give this experience for developers through 
our module dashboard. 

Developers have to follow only few steps to get the module listed.

1. Verify their account on the Dashboard (https://dashboard.zenguard.xyz)
2. Develop and deploy the module using the [template](https://github.com/zenguardxyz/module-template)
3. Publish the module using contract address or repo link at: https://dashboard.zenguard.xyz/#/publish

That's it!. The module will be automatically listed on the ZenGuard Module [Marktetplace](https://explore.zenguard.xyz).

Here is a quick demo of the module publishing flow.
